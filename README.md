## About me


**Joesepe/Joesepe** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a railgun but physics is hard
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to controll electric current and magnetic fields
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about knots of any kind
- âš¡ Fun fact: *Why do you read this?*
